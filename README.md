# -EEG-of-healthy-adolescents-and-adolescents-with-symptoms-of-schizophrenia
There are two EEG data archives for two groups of subjects. The subjects were adolescents who had been screened by psychiatrist and devided into two groups: healthy (n = 39) and with symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 45).

Each file contains an EEG record for one subject. Each TXT file contains a column with EEG samples from 16 EEG channels (electrode positions). Each number in the column is an EEG amplitude (mkV) at distinct sample. First 7680 samples represent 1st channel, then 7680 - 2nd channel, ets. The sampling rate is 128 Hz, thus 7680 samples refer to 1 minute of EEG record.

The topographical positions of channel numbers are shown in the table and picture below.
